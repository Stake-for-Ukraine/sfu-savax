# Stake for Ukraine

Stake for Ukraine is a community-driven initiative with a mission to raise funds for Ukraine's fight for freedom and redevelopment of liberated territories. Our approach is to create innovative products that utilize Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) protocols on popular blockchains. This makes it possible for users to stake their governance tokens and donate the rewards earned automatically and on a recurring basis.

Our first project, sfuAVAX, is currently in development. It's a wrapper around sAVAX (staked AVAX) created by Benq.finance, designed to enable easy staking and donating for supporters of Ukraine's cause.
