# Stake for Ukraine

Stake for Ukraine is a community initiative that has as its goal to raise funds from a broader blockchain community to support Ukraine in it's effort in its fight for freedom and redevelopment of liberated territories.

Our main approach to this is by building products around existing Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) protocols on popular blockchains. That will allow user to stake their governance token and donate the rewards earned on recurring basis automatically.

Currently we are working on our first project sfuAVAX. It is a wrapper around sAVAX (staked AVAX) developed by Benq.finance.
